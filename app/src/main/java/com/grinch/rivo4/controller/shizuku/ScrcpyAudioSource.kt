/**
 * All audio sources supported by scrcpy-server, with metadata for the Settings UI.
 *
 * Each entry maps directly to an Android [android.media.MediaRecorder.AudioSource] constant
 * used by scrcpy-server.  Source reference:
 *  https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/genymobile/scrcpy/audio/AudioSource.java
 *
 * Each entry carries:
 *  - [cliKey]           — the exact string passed to scrcpy-server's `audio_source=` argument.
 *  - [titleResId]       — the string resource ID for the human-readable name shown in the dropdown.
 *  - [descriptionResId] — the string resource ID for the one-line description shown below the dropdown.
 *  - [minApi]           — the minimum Android API level required for this source.
 *  - [maxApi]           — the maximum Android API level that supports this source, or null if unbounded.
 *  - [isDebugOnly]      — when `true` the entry is hidden unless the debug panel is enabled.
 *
 * The Settings screen generates its dropdown by iterating [entries] and filtering on [isDebugOnly],
 * so adding a new audio source only requires adding a new enum entry here (plus string resources).
 *
 * @property cliKey          scrcpy `audio_source` CLI key (e.g. "mic-voice-communication").
 * @property titleResId      String resource ID for the display name.
 * @property descriptionResId String resource ID for the one-line description.
 * @property minApi          Minimum Android API level required (inclusive).
 * @property maxApi          Maximum Android API level supported (inclusive), or null for no upper bound.
 * @property isDebugOnly     `true` if this source should only appear when debug mode is active.
